I am currently working as a senior consultant at Deloitte within the Risk, Data, and Analytics team of Risk Advisory. 

I have extensive experience using deep learning and statistical techniques (through both personal, academic, and work-related projects) with a wide variety of data, spanning high-frequency signals (e.g., sensor data/simulation data/speech data), financial data (e.g., financial risk computations), health science related data (biological signals, lesion images, knowledge graphs, protein/small mollecule embeddings), and traffic network data.

My interests revolve around
* graph neural networks and generative models,
* bias mitigation and safety in deep learning,
* democratization of deep learning through network compression/pruning techniques.
