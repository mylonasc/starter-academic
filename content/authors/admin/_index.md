I hold a Ph.D. and M.Sc. from ETH Zurich and specialize in Machine Learning, with focus in deep learning, scientific computing, software engineering, and I have worked on consulting projects in risk management for financial institutions.

ðŸŽ“During my Ph.D., I focused on developing cutting-edge deep learning techniques, including Graph Neural Networks, Bayesian Deep Learning for Generative Modeling (e.g., VAEs for graph-structured data), and Bayesian predictive models for time-series on graphs.
I also contributed to Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) research, designing Bayesian models for high-frequency time-series and co-authoring work on Neural ODEs in Engineering.

ðŸ’¼ In my Big4 consulting career, I worked on energy market analytics, liquidity and credit risk automation systems, and developed cryptocurrency transaction analytics prototypes. I played a key role in early asset development for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM prototypes, introduced DevOps processes, and conducted internal seminars on RAG and LLM technologies.

ðŸŽ¹ Outside of work, I enjoy playing music, tinkering with microcontrollers and software automation, and staying engaged with deep learning research.
See below for some of my recent personal projects.

# -----------
# I am a M.Sc. and Ph.D. graduate from ETH Zurich, working as a ML engineer (details to be updated).
#
# [link to my CV]( uploads/MylonasCharilaos_Oct24_nt_v3-1.pdf)
#
# My core skills are machine learning (deep learning), scientific computing, software engineering and financial risk management.
#
# ðŸŽ“ My deep learning-related work is on Graph Neural Networks ([1](https://github.com/mylonasc/tf_gnns)), Bayesian Deep Learning for Generative modeling (e.g., ([3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/we.2621), [4](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/385323/4/GeneGolubPoster.pdf)) ) and their fusion (e.g., such as VAEs for graph structured data [5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16049), and Bayesian predictive models for time-series on graphs [6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06791)). I have also developed Bayesian deep learning models for high frequency time-series in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) ([7](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/19/6325)), and co-authored papers on using Neural ODEs for SHM ([8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022460X21002686)). 
#
# These are some of the techniques I employed during my [PhD](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/511551) at ETH Zurich.
#
# ðŸ’¼ In my previous role in consulting (recently resigned in order to pursue other opportunities), I've worked in business development for energy market analytics, I have contributed to the assessment of liquidity and credit risk systems, and created cryptocurrency transaction analytics prototypes. I have also been involved in defining the requirements, coordinating efforts, and contributing to early asset development of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) LLM-prototypes, introduced DevOps processes, and provided several internal seminars on RAG and LLM technology.
#
# ðŸŽ¹ In my free time, I play music and hack-around with microcontrollers, software engineering and automation, and keep up with deep learning research.
