I am a senior consultant at Deloitte within the Risk, Data, and Analytics team of Risk Advisory.

My core skills are in deep learning and ML. 

More speciffically, my main expertise is on (Message-passing) Graph Neural Networks ([1](https://github.com/mylonasc/tf_gnns)), Bayesian Deep Learning for Generative modeling (e.g., ([3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/we.2621), [4](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/385323/4/GeneGolubPoster.pdf)) ) and their fusion (e.g., such as VAEs for graph structured data [5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16049), and Bayesian predictive models for time-series on graphs [6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06791)). I have also developed Bayesian deep learning models for "irregular" time-series occuring in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) ([7](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/19/6325)), and co-authored papers on using Neural ODEs for SHM ([8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022460X21002686)). 

These are some of the techniques I employed during my [PhD](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/511551) at ETH Zurich.
