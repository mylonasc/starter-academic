I hold a Ph.D. and M.Sc. from ETH Zurich and specialize in Machine Learning, with focus in deep learning, scientific computing, software engineering, and I have worked on consulting projects in risk management for financial institutions.

ðŸŽ“During my Ph.D., I focused on developing cutting-edge deep learning techniques, including Graph Neural Networks, Bayesian Deep Learning for Generative Modeling (e.g., VAEs for graph-structured data), and Bayesian predictive models for time-series on graphs.
I also contributed to Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) research, designing Bayesian models for high-frequency time-series and co-authoring work on Neural ODEs in Engineering.

ðŸ’¼ In my Big4 consulting career, I worked on energy market analytics, liquidity and credit risk automation systems, and developed cryptocurrency transaction analytics prototypes. I played a key role in early asset development for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) LLM prototypes, introduced DevOps processes, and conducted internal seminars on RAG and LLM technologies.

ðŸŽ¹ Outside of work, I enjoy playing music, tinkering with microcontrollers and software automation, and staying engaged with deep learning research.
See below for some of my recent personal projects.
