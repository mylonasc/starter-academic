summary: established and co-organized a community of pratice for data science in engineering.
abstract: "(poster on VAEs for wind farms) Became friends with some amazing PhD researchers on computational science during a 2-week session! Exposed to the idea of matrix sketching, gradient-based tensor decompositions, and Determinatal Point Processes. Favorite highlight (apart from awesome French cheese and wine) the talk by T. Kolda on tensor decompositions."
