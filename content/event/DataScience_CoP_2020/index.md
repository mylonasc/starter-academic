summary: established and co-organized a community of pratice for data science in engineering.
abstract: "Since the start of 2020, with some PhD students that were interested in incorporating deep learning and reinforcement learning in their research, we were discussing the organization of a series of recurring workshops to share our research and create a platform for feedback. Now (2024) I know what we were trying to achieve is called a **community of practice (CoP)** or what was called a **ML Guild**. Our professors were very supportive in creating this and 'volunteered' us to organize a department-wide workshop where PhD students that had an ML component to their research could present their work.

The workshop was a big success (around 100 researchers at all levels participated in total) and everyone had the opportunity to network and expose their work."
